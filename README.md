Hey there 👋
I’m Ritwik, a backend developer on a journey into the MERN stack 🌱

🔧 Tech I use & enjoy

⚡ Node.js for building scalable backends

🗄️ MongoDB for managing data that grows with apps

🐳 Docker (just enough to keep my projects afloat 😅)

🎨 React — learning to bring full-stack ideas to life

💡 What I’m working on

Crafting APIs and diving deep into databases

Leveling up in MERN, one commit at a time

🌍 I enjoy side projects, and nerding out about clean architecture or cool new tech.
Always happy to learn, share, and build awesome stuff 🚀
